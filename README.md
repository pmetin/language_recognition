# Language recognition app

This app automatically recognizes the language of a text. The longer the text, the better the prediction. The app will suggest a second possible language when appropriate.
It can be used through a Streamlit web interface.

The app mainly uses the langdetect python library : https://pypi.org/project/langdetect/#description 

The web interface is accessible here : https://language-recognition.streamlit.app/
